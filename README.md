Abstract
--------
Dystruct is a little C-Library that lets you easily build your own
C-Structures at runtime.

If you, for example, don't know which kinds of structures you have to pass to a
dynamically called function (libffi) , you have to build them on the heap at runtime. This
Library does just that while taking care about the correct alignment of the 
members. 

Installation
-----------
Just follow the instructions in INSTALL
